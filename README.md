Hi ðŸ‘‹ I am George Appiah 

# DevOps Engineer and 2x AWS certified 

Before DevOps I was a product designer and webflow
developer. I studied that to understand software 
development process, ability to empathize, and  
simplify complexity. Check out my portfolio I'm still receiving feedback ðŸ˜…( https://the-george-kwabena.webflow.io/ )

Before deciding to become a product designer, 
I self-studied digital marketing. These skill 
parallel nicely with being a product designer 
as I have experienced understanding markets, 
talking to consumers and building products
based on the user's wants and needs.

Before I wrap up I'm a web3 enthusiast and DeFi believer. I'm  currently building Communities at Defi Africa( Defiafrica.net).
I have been in the Blockchain space since late 2017. Watch my video ( https://youtu.be/R93kdW39QB0 ) where I spoke about Blockchain 5years ago on radio station in Ghana.
